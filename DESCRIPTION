Title:  Call Marker from Snp Data using Binmap
Description: The raw NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) variants called 
    from GBS (Genotyping by Sequencing) / WES (Whole Exon Sequencing)/
    WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) may include many error site, binmapr 
    use binmap strategy to generate a high confident marker for downstream
    analysis, such as QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping, genetic map 
    construction. A list of reference for this package is, Davey, J.W.,
